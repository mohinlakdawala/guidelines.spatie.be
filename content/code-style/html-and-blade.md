# HTML and Blade

If you see yourself copying and pasting various blocks of HTML between multiple view files, consider extracting the HTML as a component or a partial. This way the HTML would be DRY.

Only use blade directives - for eg. @if, @foreach, @for, @php and avoid using core PHP if, foreach tags etc. Using blade @foreach syntax would provide access to some Incredibly useful loop variables that can be used for checking index, whether first element or last element etc. Go through the below link to read more about these variables.

```html
<!-- Good -->
@foreach ($posts as $post)
    <h2>$post->title</h2>
@endforeach

<!-- Bad -->
<?php foreach($posts as $post) : ?>
    <h2>$post->title</h2>
<?php endforeach; ?>
```

Do **NOT** include any logic in Blade files. They are meant only for displaying data in a specific structure and thus they should not have to deal with any calculations or data manipulations or any other business logic.

Do **NOT** forget to include proper favicons. Use the following service which lets us handle icons for all devices.

>Quick tip: The HTML tags for the various favicons generated by the above service can be extracted to a partial, which can then be re-used in multiple layouts eg. admin, frontend, login etc.
