# Going Live

When a project moves from development to production, we need to go through numerous steps to get it ready for real world usage. 

Some steps are common across all the projects, especially if developed with Laravel. If the project requires any other steps then the common ones, the README of the project should be updated , during the course of development, with the list of the points that should be taken care of when going live.
